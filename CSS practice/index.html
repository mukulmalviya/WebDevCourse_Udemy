    <h1>Aang - The last airbender</h1>
    <hr>
    <sub> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </sub> <br>

    <p>
        Avatar Aang (Chinese: 安昂; pinyin: Ān Áng) is a title character and the protagonist of Nickelodeon's animated
        television series Avatar: The Last Airbender (created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko), voiced by
        Zach Tyler Eisen. Aang is the last surviving Airbender, a monk of the Air Nomads' Southern Air Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
        He is an incarnation of the "Avatar", the spirit of light and peace manifested in human form. As the Avatar,
        Aang
        controls all four elements (water, earth, fire, and air) and is tasked with bringing balance and keeping the
        Four
        Nations at peace. At 112 years old (physically 12), Aang is the series' reluctant hero, spending a century in
        suspended animation in an iceberg before being discovered and joining new friends Katara and Sokka on a quest to
        master the elements and save their world from the imperialist Fire Nation.

        Aang's character has appeared in other media, such as trading cards,[1][2] video games,[3][4] T-shirts,[5] and
        web
        comics.[6] Aang has also been portrayed by Noah Ringer in the live-action film The Last Airbender (2010),[7] and
        voiced by D.B. Sweeney in the sequel series The Legend of Korra.

    <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender </h3>
    <p>
        Upon death, Avatar Roku was reincarnated and Aang was born, and later raised by Monk Gyatso, a senior monk at
        the
        Southern Air Temple and friend of the late Avatar Roku. Even prior to learning he was the Avatar, Aang
        distinguished
        himself by becoming one of the youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique. As a result
        of
        Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal
        Aang's
        nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they
        turn
        16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples.[8][9] Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused
        Aang
        to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions
        triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he
        remained suspended for a century. Although Monk Gyatso had snuck into Aang's bedroom late at night to tell Aang
        that
        he won’t be relocated to the Eastern Air Temple, it had already been too late.[10][9]

    <h3>Book One: Water</h3>
    <p>
        After one hundred years of suspended animation in an iceberg, twelve-year-old Aang was freed when found by
        Katara
        and Sokka, yet unaware of the events that occurred during his rest.[10] His reawakening catches the attention of
        Zuko, the banished prince of the Fire Nation, and Aang is forced to leave, with Katara and Sokka accompanying
        him
        after they learn that he is the Avatar.[11] Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple, where they
        meet
        a winged lemur whom Aang later names Momo. It is there that Aang learns that the Fire Nation wiped out his
        people,
        including Gyatso which causes Aang to summon his avatar spirit and the other 3 nations find out the avatar is
        back.
        After a series of misadventures, Aang meets his previous incarnation, Roku, who informs him that he must master
        all
        four bending arts and end the war before the coming of Sozin's Comet at the end of summer.[12] Upon arriving to
        the
        Northern Water Tribe, after a few conflicts, Aang became an apprentice of Waterbending Master Pakku alongside
        Katara.[13] After helping the Water Tribe drive off a Fire Nation invasion headed by Admiral Zhao, with Katara
        as
        his teacher, Aang and his group journey to the Earth Kingdom to find an Earthbending teacher. Meanwhile, Fire
        Lord
        Ozai, angered that Iroh betrayed the Fire Nation, sends his daughter, Princess Azula, to hunt down Zuko and
        Iroh.[14]

    <h3>Book Two: Earth </h3>
    <p>
        In the second season, Aang learns Earthbending from Toph Beifong[15] after he has a vision of the blind
        Earthbender
        in a swamp telling him to find her.[16] On their journey, they are chased by Fire Princess Azula and her friends
        Mai
        and Ty Lee.[17] The group learns about the Day of Black Sun in a secret underground library, and they attempt to
        reveal the information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. However, their flying bison, Appa, is captured by
        Sandbenders. Aang grows upset and angry and confronts the Sandbenders, learning that Appa has been sold. After
        stopping a Fire Nation drill threatening the safety of Ba Sing Se, they look for Appa only to find themselves
        dealing with the Dai Li before exposing their leader's deception. The group reunites with Jet helping them find
        Appa
        at Dai Li headquarters. They expose the Hundred Year War to the Earth King, who promises to help them invade the
        Fire Nation. Soon after, Aang meets a guru who attempts to teach Aang to open his seven chakras in order to
        control
        the defensive 'Avatar State'; but when Aang perceives Katara in danger, he leaves before the seventh chakra is
        opened, and thus loses his progress until the seventh is opened.[18] Though Aang manages to unlock the Seventh
        Chakra, he is fatally electrocuted by Azula. He is later brought back to life by Katara, using the spirit water
        given to her by the Northern Water Tribe at the start of the second season.[19]

    <h3>Book Three: Fire </h3>
    <p>
        In the third and final season, Aang is unable to use the Avatar State. Although reluctant with the plan at
        first,
        Aang accepts to have everyone think he had died and his remaining allies attack the Fire Nation's capital, but
        are
        thwarted by Azula.[20] However, Zuko has a change of heart, rebels against his father,[21] and offers to teach
        Aang
        Firebending. Aang and Zuko also improve their Firebending powers with the help of their world's last two
        dragons.[22] (In this part of the show, he is 13) During the finale, finding himself on a strange island, Aang
        is
        reluctant to actually kill Fire Lord Ozai, despite his four previous past lives (Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and
        Yangchen)
        convincing him it is the only way. But upon learning that he was actually on the back of a Lion Turtle, one of
        four
        that made the first benders by manipulating humans' chi, Aang receives the Lion Turtles' Energybending. During
        the
        final battle, Aang's scar is pressed against a jutting rock, opening his chakras and allowing him to enter the
        Avatar State. Aang wins the battle, but before he delivers the final blow, he stops himself. Instead, Aang
        removes
        Ozai's bending ability, rendering him harmless and ending the Hundred Year War. Later, in the Fire Nation
        capital,
        Aang is seen beside Zuko, the new Fire Lord. The series ends with Aang and his friends relaxing at Iroh's tea
        shop
        at Ba Sing Se, where Aang and Katara share a kiss.[23]
